Art Jam Response

Going through every art jam project posted on moodle, many stood out as interesting ideas with wonderful execution. However, the three assignments that really stood out to me were ones that I felt stayed within the original art jam guidelines, while also incorporating very obvious and personal stylistic choices. This means that, for me, ones that were portraits with fun little quirks layered on top ended up being my favourites.

Firstly, one of the submissions that really impressed me was Christie’s art jam, appropriately titled “Art Jam\!”. I especially liked this one because it’s so appealing. The use of shapes to construct the face and hair, although simple, are so effective at influencing me to feel some sort of joy. Furthermore, even though this is a little detail, I also like that the eyes are closed, which helps amplify that serene and bubbly feeling I was getting from my first impressions. In terms of interactivity, I felt this one also really succeeded at making me excited with the simplest of mechanics. I already thought it was unique that the little white circles blossomed into flowers as the cursor passed their position while moving to the right of the canvas. However, when my cursor reached beyond the limits of the canvas on the right hand side and I moved my cursor up and down, I was genuinely surprised that the flowers rotated because of how unique it was compared to what I conjured up for my own project, but also because of how the project lured me into engaging with the mechanics by changing the background color in relation to the cursor’s position on the x axis. Overall, I thought Christie’s project was super unique and really amusing despite its simplicity.

Secondly, I would also like to praise Camelia’s art jam, aptly titled “Cam’s Self-Portrait”. Once again I found myself invested in this one due to the unique artistic expression. I love pixel art just as much as the next person, yet I had never considered using it for my own project. Upon further inspection, I also realized the pixel art aided a lot of the mechanics, and helped them feel quite refined. For instance, the sudden background changes and the jewelry that appears and disappears with a click of the mouse feel pretty well integrated because of the art style; it almost feels like an 8 bit character customizer where the time of day changes. Beyond that, what really stood out to me with this submission was the eye movement. I saw it in many other projects as well, but the pixel art makes the eye darts here feel especially smooth, since it’s confined to the shape of a square. On top of that, being able to move the black parts of the pupil from side to side and the white part of the pupil up and down made the mechanics feel quite engaging to me. It sort of reminded me of a very basic puzzle, and the variety of expressions I felt I could get based on what I perceived the actual eyes to be from their position compelled me quite a bit. For the reasons stated previously, I really enjoyed Camelia’s art jam.

Finally, I would like to highlight Ya Xuan’s art jam, titled “Art-Jam Self Portrait”. This one was really striking to me due to how well I found everything to be executed. I was impressed by the simplicity similarly to how I felt about Christie’s project. The basic shapes to form the self portrait return here, but with added objects surrounding the subject which was a pleasant surprise and something I hadn’t thought of for my project. I enjoyed looking around with the cursor for all of the objects as if it was a spotlight, and the amount of detail is perfectly spread out between each object. This is another project that I also felt got the eyes to be really smooth and convincing. The mechanic also made sense in what I assume is the context of the art jam. I felt as though the character was daydreaming about the things they enjoy, and that they were focused on them when highlighted since the cursor reveals the objects, and the eyes follow the cursor. The interactivity with the sky appearing when the mouse is pressed was also very clever in my opinion. If I follow my own interpretation of the submission, it also felt as if holding down the mouse represented a stressed state of mind within the character. In other words, the stress of holding down the mouse button is linked to the character feeling progressively more antsy, hence why the clouds darken. Overall, the interpretations I was able to come up with based on the mechanics present within Ya Xuan’s art jam made it very entertaining.
