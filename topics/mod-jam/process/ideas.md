\#Mod Jam Ideas

1. Flies get faster as time progresses (How does the player lose? Do they lose if they miss a fly? Does the speed of the fly determine the score? If so, how would I calculate that? Ok idea in general but I’m struggling with the score and I also don’t think the game really needs this based on the existing frogfrogfrog project)

2. Frog has a health bar that goes down if it misses a fly (Do flies that move differently make the bar go down quicker if missed? Maybe they give more leeway since they’re harder to hit? Should they appear more as the game progresses? Simple idea and certainly doable, but maybe lacks some personality)

3. Some flies are diseased which makes the frog sick (What makes the players catch these flies? Why not just avoid them? What in their movement pattern could make them more of an obstacle? Not too sure how I would make them move in a way that could feasibly be fair and make the player lose)

4. Special flies are worth more points (What makes them more valuable? Are they harder to catch? Are they rarer? What other bugs should I include? A nice broad idea but should be refined or developed a bit more)

5. Some flies can go invisible by turning the same colour as the background, but offer more points when eaten (I don’t like this one purely because it doesn’t make logical sense for flies to turn invisible like Miles Morales)

6. Lilypads float in the background that can get the frog’s tongue stuck for a short period of time (What benefit does this have for the player experience? I guess it incentivises the player to hit the bugs? Maybe you lose health based on the amount of times you get stuck? Nice simple idea, might be worth exploring)

7. Extra bugs change the frog’s diet (What benefit is there to changing your diet? Maybe the frog gets less nutritional value in one area if he only consumes one type of bug? Maybe the frog gets more points when he eats more of a variety of bugs? Maybe there are bars that deplete while the frog isn’t eating the specified bug? Maybe once one bar is depleted the frog loses? Maybe rarer bug’s bars deplete less quickly than a fly? Solid idea, definitely worth exploring)

8. Frog gets a special move when he eats enough flies (What’s the special move? How does the frog feel the need to use it when the initial game is so simple? Already stumped, next idea.)

9. Some flies are secret agents that can electrocute the frog (What happens when the frog gets electrocuted? Does he immediately lose? How does the frog know that a fly won’t electrocute him? What incentivises the frog to eat electrical flies? If he survives does he get more points? Like getting struck by lightning but living? Does the frog eventually gain a resistance to shocks? Ok idea but I’m unsure how the player would actually lose in a satisfying way that would keep them playing)

10. The frog can catch a fishing rod attached to a special fly that makes him instantly lose (What happens when the frog catches the fishing rod? Are there indicators in the movement of the lure that it’s not a real fly? If so, what are they? What happens when the frog gets pulled by the fishing rod? Sure he loses but visually what happens? Does the frog now need a whole body? Cool idea but requires too much visual fiddling to be something that I can feasibly accomplish well)  
      
11. Flies have a chance to dodge the frog’s tongue, the more they dodge the more points they are worth (How do flies with nonlinear movement dodge the frog’s tongue? This one question actually makes me not want to do this idea so moving swiftly on.)

12. Fly mafia goes after the frog when he eats too many flies (How does the fly mafia operate? How do they defeat the frog? Maybe their goal is to get eaten to take him out from the inside? Maybe they can throw knives towards the tongue when it shoots out to catch a regular fly? It makes them more inconspicuous which is nice. Are there regular and mafia flies on the screen at once? How does the player lose? Maybe a heart bar that drains when the frog ingests too many knives? What happens if the frog ingests the mafia fly? Do more mafia flies start to appear? Solid idea, maybe the frog wins by outlasting the mafia. If regular flies move in sine waves then players would be incentivised to eat then when at the bottom of their movement pattern. Not bad, definitely in consideration.)  
      
13. Some flies are macho flies that can hold onto the frog’s tongue (How are the macho flies distinguished from the regular flies? If you hit too many of them what happens? How can the player lose if the macho flies are too obvious to hit? Maybe the player loses if they miss a regular fly? If so then maybe the flies get fast enough that eventually the player will inevitably hit a macho fly? Ok idea in concept but might be a little easy for the players)

14. Frog has eyes that follow the fly but can get dizzy, so has to close his eyes to let motion sickness die down (How would I make the eyes follow the flies? How would these flies’ movements affect the dizzy meter? Maybe a sine wave moving fly makes the frog dizzier than a linear moving fly? How quickly would motion sickness die down? How would the frog lose beyond just getting dizzy? Maybe while his eyes are closed the flies attack him? Good idea in theory but I’m struggling to find a way to make everything happen.)

15. Mathematician frog needs flies to add to an abacus (How is the scoreboard drawn? Do certain flies count for more on the abacus? What determines the flies’ values? How would this frog lose? By losing count? Maybe the player has to input counts based on the flies that have been caught. Would that be too much for the player to handle? The idea has potential but may be too complicated, however if I simplify it somehow, I might really like this one.)

16. Stealth agent frog takes out fly royalty and scores higher when offing an important fly, but lower when offing a civilian fly (How do royal flies move compared to civilian flies? How do I know which flies are which? How does the scoreboard keep track of the amount of royal flies killed? Does it track them by point value or amount eaten? Are there multiple flies showing up at once? The idea has potential but I think I can do better.)

17. The cop frog has to eat different evil flies to meet his quota (Does the frog have a hat? How does the cop lose? Maybe if he eats a civilian? But that might make the game unloseable depending on what the civilians do. Maybe the criminal flies can disguise themselves as civilians to incentivise hitting them? I like this idea conceptually but I don’t really know how I’d make the player lose and want to replay.)  
      
18. Some flies can shoot back at the frog with some weapons being rarer than others (How will they shoot? How many weapons will they have? Will flies with weapons move differently based on what they have? This idea feels a bit convoluted and lacking in focus, especially if I need to implement the flies having different movement patterns)  
      
19. The fly army moves towards the frog to attack him because the many will always prevail against the few (How do the flies damage you? Maybe they stick to you and suck away health? How will the tongue meet them in other directions? Match the cursor position? I fear this one will either be too easy for the player or too hard for me to feasibly make)  
      
20. Frog gets older so his tongue moves slower with time (Wrinkles appear as he gets older? Time increases each time you restart based on the amount of flies eaten? Maybe eating enough flies will bless you by the frog god in the afterlife? Idea might be better combined with another concept)
