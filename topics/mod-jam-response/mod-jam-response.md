Art Jam Response

After having checked out the mod jams of others on moodle, I noticed just how varied and interesting everyone’s ideas were. It seems everyone had different angles on how to tackle the assignment and there weren’t any submissions that I felt were derivative of each other or repetitive in spite of everyone working with the original “frogfrogfrog” repository as a baseline. With so much diversity, I found it pretty challenging to pick and choose which projects stood out the most. With that being said though, the three mod jams that impressed me the most for one reason or another were Lucas’ project, Yann’s project, and Tasha’s project.

Starting off with Lucas’ approach to modifying the original “frogfrogfrog” concept, I was really impressed by how the game functioned mechanically. It’s still very simple to be sure, but incredibly engaging nonetheless. I think the build up he had for the eventual fly boss battle was really well done, as I found myself wondering what I was capturing the flies for, on top of the cryptic messages popping up on screen warning the player to stop catching flies making me wonder what I was building towards. So, once the boss battle actually started, I was genuinely surprised. It offers a solid challenge if the player isn’t careful as well, with the frog having significantly less health than the boss, and having to position underneath the boss to directly hit it with the frog’s tongue. The fact that the boss has multiple phases was also a nice surprise, as it wasn’t something I was expecting beyond simply having a boss fight. The phases also progress in difficulty well. It never gets frustrating, it always feels engaging, and it’s simply an incredible way to interpret modifying the original concept.

Next up, we have Yann’s project. The reason this one stood out to me is actually a little biased on my behalf. Going through the mod jams of my fellow classmates, I was pretty surprised that none of the ideas I thought were compelling that I came up with appeared in anyone’s project. The one exception being this mod jam. The idea of the flies dodging the frog’s tongue is one that I also heavily considered, so seeing it be implemented by someone else was a really pleasant surprise for me. Not to mention, it’s also implemented well with the other modifications that were brought to the original project. The addition of the timer counting down meaning you really don’t want to see flies dodging your tongue makes every time the player shoots out the frog’s tongue engaging. On top of that, the higher of a score you get, the more difficult it is to break your own personal record, as it gets more and more difficult to add to your time over the course of any play session. Like Lucas’ project, I found this one really engaging, mechanically fun, and just the right amount of challenging. The added bonus of the background moving at higher speeds similar to some other mobile games is also a nice touch, since it adds that extra little bit of flair to the project. Overall, I found this mod jam really interesting conceptually and enjoyable mechanically.

Lastly, there’s Tasha’s project. Visually, this mod jam distinguishes itself by being very pleasant to look at. I was surprised at just how appealing the introductory screen was. The frog looks great and the pixie simulating Navi from the Zelda franchise is recognizable and a cool easter egg. Even starting the game is fun and interactive, having the tongue shoot out from the frog to press start, informing the player of their main action while playing the game. Pretty as it is to look at, I am pleased to say that the actual gameplay loop is equally as fun. The frog has an easily visible health bar that changes colour to inform the player how close the frog is to death. The pond is the main indicator of pollution along with the bar at the top of the screen. The flies that heal you are visually very distinct from the ones that damage you but keep the pond from being polluted. Everything here is astonishingly visually clear and mechanically sound. Having to balance the pond’s pollution and the frog’s health results in a healthy challenge. All in all, I was extremely impressed with this mod jam, as well as the two projects I wrote about previously.
