## Description

This is the first piece of code I've ever written purely by myself. I call it: "Liam Says Hello :D" by yours truly, Liam St-Georges.

> *Liam Says Hello :D* is a simple interactive demonstration of my current capabilities with p5 and JavaScript.

> There is purpetual change over time with the eyebrows moving up and down, which is beyond the user's control. What isn't, however, is the use of the cursor, which is illustrated as Liam's arm. The arm will follow the mouse's position on the canvas, and will change hand signs while holding down a mouse button.

> Most p5 functions used in this project I have had previous experiences with. However, some that were new to me here are arc(), line(), quad(), and mousePressed(). It is also the first time I have personally used velocity in an if statement.

## Screenshot(s)

Here is what the program should look like in your browser.
